            <h3 class='mainPointFont'>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS
                support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of
                folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.</p>

            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see
                with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the
                web.</p>

            <h3 class='mainPointFont'>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
            There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
            participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the
            style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external
            CSS file. Yes, really.

            CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
            illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are
            placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
            contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</div>
