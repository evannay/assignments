    <h1>Salt Lake City Rumors</h1>
    <h3>Earthquake Imminent!!</h3>
    <p> No matter where you live, it seems the 'big one' is just around the corner or, in Utah's case, overdue.  
        Scott Tucker has the full story and, when asked, he hit us hard with his answer, "It's gonna hit today!"
        Of course, no one really knows but like, for real, it could be today.  My mom has been telling me for 30
        years that Seattle is overdue for 'the Big One'.  I told her I ain't got time for that shiz.  We all gonna die
        one day anyway.  If it from ain't a gun, being fired at you while you ride away on a man-eating shark then you ain't living right. . . it's a joke.</p>
    <p> It's been a <span class="blue">wet</span> spring, and now the sun is beating down, boiling the water and causing the next earthquake in the valley to almost certianly be a <span class="underline">doomsday quake</span> worthy of the book of Revelation!
        We'll have to see if those who have put their faith in these mountains since before anyone else lived here (what Indians?) continue to do so as the deadline for the quake is approximately 20 years overdue.  Apparently, you have to type the right amount
    of text to make it even?  That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.</p>
    <p>Doubters, traitors amongst the loyal, are being weeded out as they confidently head for the hills to continue skiing in July, apparently all too confident that this is simply a farse.  It wouldn't be the first time Utah has said something will go one way, and it really goes another.
        No one knows for sure the date or time, but know this. . . the quake is coming.  Fear everything!  Maybe, you can be in the process of skiing while it happens
        so you can just ski the baddest avalanche this state has ever witnessed.  Goin' out like a true badass!  Let us not forget that Utah is the only state that allows you to ride a motorcyle with no helmet (Freedom!), talk on your phone while driving a car (Freedom!), and you and your dog can buy a gun
    (Freedom!), but Lord forbid you want to buy a beer on a holiday.  I want a mimosa at 11:00am and I'm told to 'think of the children'.</p>
